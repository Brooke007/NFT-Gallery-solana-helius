> A new era of NFT creation， Let's **alive** all the NFTs

## 1.Description

In the realm of large-scale digital art creation and collaboration, current blockchain platforms often face challenges such as difficulties in organizing and focusing creativity. Many on-chain NFT platforms lack flexible creation tools and are unable to provide an in-depth collaborative and creative experience. Additionally, real-time collaboration and rapid iterative creation are also problematic in many on-chain environments due to transaction costs and speed limitations. `Alivet` addresses these issues by leveraging the advanced technology of Solana. Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs make large-scale collaboration and rapid NFT creation possible, while ensuring the security and efficiency of transactions. On the `Alivet` platform, artists and enthusiasts can not only collaborate to create NFTs but also manage and showcase their work in a structured way.

## 2.Alivet for Solana

- `Alivet` is an NFT secondary creation and community interaction platform based on the Solana blockchain, designed to provide a novel interactive environment for digital art enthusiasts and creators. Through `Alivet`, users can import NFTs from their wallets into an online editor, make various creative adjustments and add animations, and finally save and export as a brand new NFT. This allows for personalization and interactivity, while being economically viable for transactions on the Solana platform. Through a token incentive mechanism and community platform, `Alivet` further encourages users to participate in secondary creation and community discussions, promoting community activity and circulation of works.

- **V1**

  In version V1, `Alivet` allows users to read NFTs from their wallets and drag them onto an online canvas for editing, including actions such as enlarging, shrinking, rotating, moving, etc. It also records the position and changes of the NFT on the canvas to create animation effects. Users can save and export animation frames to form a new NFT with animated effects, minting it into their wallet as a brand new digital artwork.

- **V2**

  In version V2, `Alivet` introduces a token incentive mechanism to encourage users to engage in secondary creation and sharing of NFTs. The platform establishes an environment similar to a community forum where users can post, discuss, and reward secondary NFT creations. Community tokens are issued as incentives, distributed based on community interactions like likes, collections, and citations, similar to the mechanisms that motivate creators on video platforms through likes, collections, comments, etc.

- **V3**

  Version V3 will upgrade the user interface and adjust incentive strategies and other features based on community feedback to enhance user experience. This version introduces several new features, including but not limited to:

  1. **AI Background Removal Function**: Automatically removes the background of the original NFT, facilitating creation based on the elements of the original NFT.
  2. **AI Painting Function**: Automatically generates different animations based on the elements of the imported NFT, providing more creative inspiration.
  3. **Paid Canvas and Backgrounds**: Offers various canvas and background options, some of which may require payment to unlock, adding to the diversity of creation.
  4. **Custom NFT Frames**: Users can choose different NFT frame designs to add personalization to their NFTs.
  5. **NFT Authorization Function**: Users can authorize others to create secondary works on their NFTs, choosing to do so for free or for a fee, addressing copyright and ownership issues.
  6. **NFT Rental Function**: Artists can use tokens to rent other users' NFTs for creation, addressing copyright and ownership issues, while expanding the source of creative materials.
  7. **Advanced Canvas Core Functions**: Offers functions closer to professional canvas tools, aiming for a better NFT art creation experience.

  Through the continuous improvement and update of these features, `Alivet` aims to inspire user creativity, deepen exchanges among NFT community members, increase the liquidity of NFTs, and explore new frontiers in the combination of NFTs and blockchain technology.

`Alivet` combines the cNFT technology on the Solana blockchain to create a thriving and collaborative digital art creation community. With the indispensable benefits of cNFT, `Alivet` provides users with an efficient, low-cost, and easy-to-manage creation environment.

**Key Support of cNFT**:

1. **Increased Efficiency**: By combining multiple NFTs into one cNFT, we reduce transactions and network congestion, achieving seamless collaborative creation among different creators.
2. **Reduced Costs**: When transacting with cNFTs, creators can share the Gas fees, significantly reducing the overall cost of collaboration, making participation more accessible.
3. **Enhanced Asset Liquidity**: Creators with multiple low-value NFTs find it easier to engage in decentralized financial activities and transactions within the community, enhancing asset liquidity in scenarios of mass co-creation.
4. **Simplified Management**: Creators don't need to manage each NFT individually, reducing operational complexity and increasing efficiency.
5. **Improved Scalability**: cNFTs are more developer-friendly, allowing for the large-scale automatic generation of NFTs representing collective works.
6. **Increased Security**: The inherent structure of cNFTs increases resilience against potential attacks, enhancing the security of the entire platform.

`Alivet` aims to promote the development and innovation of digital art by combining the advantages of cNFT, providing creators with a seamless, efficient, and secure collaboration platform. Our goal is to inspire more creativity, foster interaction within the community, and explore new possibilities in the integration of NFTs and blockchain technology.
